            "One of the best skills I have in my arsenal is my familiarity with the Object Oriented approach to programming. Right from the jump I learned to program with these concepts as in grade 10 my first real language was java. Over the years I have increased my familiarity with not only java, but the OOP concept itself with other languages such as C++, and C#",

I worked with range of people on a wide variety of problems in C ranging from triangle and different shape classifiers, basic file encryption software, or even an implementation of the machine learning K Nearest Neighbors algorithm (K-NN). Each of these ventures where vastly successful being great opportunities to learn.",
