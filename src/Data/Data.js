Over the years I have increased my familiarity with not only java, but the OOP concept itself with other languages such as C++, and C#",

            "In collaboration with a fellow classmate, I developed Devify, a full-stack Discord bot application aimed at transforming Discord servers into optimal communication hubs for development teams. The front-end website, built using React and hosted on Vercel, offers users a streamlined interface to access the bot's features. The backend API server, developed with Python and Flask, was hosted on Heroku alongside the bot itself. Devify is designed to enhance team collaboration with a range of helpful commands and server management features, all tailored to meet the needs of development teams. The system also utilizes a robust database to store server-specific data, ensuring customized functionality and seamless operation across different servers. This project not only demonstrated our technical skills but also our commitment to creating tools that facilitate effective teamwork and communication.",

This project involved building a bot capable of delivering a range of functionalities, from tracking and displaying player stats to providing server management tools. Developed as an open-source project and hosted on GitHub, Elo Engineer leverages Python for its core logic and Discord.py for seamless integration with Discord servers. The bot includes commands for game-related statistics, music playback, and squad management, making it an essential tool for gaming communities. Elo Engineer was developed with a focus on scalability and customization, allowing server administrators to tailor its features to their communityâ€™s specific needs. This project reflects my commitment to creating robust and useful tools for online communities.",
